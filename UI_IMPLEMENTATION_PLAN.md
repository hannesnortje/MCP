# MCP Memory Server UI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for integrating the PySide6 UI memory tab from the Autogen project into the MCP Memory Server. The implementation follows a structured branch-based workflow to ensure proper testing and version control.

## Implementation Strategy

For each step:
1. Create a new feature branch
2. Implement the described changes
3. Thoroughly test the implementation
4. Review and confirm changes
5. Merge the feature branch into master
6. Create the next feature branch

## Prerequisites

- Git properly configured
- Python environment with poetry installed
- Access to both Autogen and MCP repositories
- Basic understanding of PySide6 and Qt

## Step 1: Add Required Dependencies

**Branch name:** `feature/ui-dependencies`

### Implementation:
1. Update `pyproject.toml` to include PySide6 and related dependencies
2. Update `poetry.lock` file
3. Create basic directory structure for UI components

### Testing:
- Verify that all dependencies can be installed without conflicts
- Confirm Python environment activates correctly with new dependencies
- Validate that existing MCP functionality still works

## Step 2: Create UI Component Structure

**Branch name:** `feature/ui-component-structure`

### Implementation:
1. Create directory structure for UI components:
   ```
   src/ui/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── main.py                  # Main entry point for UI
   ├── main_window.py           # Main window implementation
   ├── memory_adapter.py        # Direct memory adapter for MCP
   └── widgets/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── memory_browser.py    # Memory browser widget
   ```
2. Create minimal placeholder implementations for each file
3. Set up import structure

### Testing:
- Verify the directory structure is created correctly
- Confirm imports work without errors
- Check that the code structure follows Python best practices

- Ensure application closes cleanly

## Step 6: Create Main UI Entry Point

**Branch name:** `feature/ui-main`

### Implementation:
1. Implement main entry point for standalone UI launch
2. Create Qt application setup
3. Add command-line argument handling
4. Implement logging and error handling

### Testing:
- Verify UI can be launched standalone
- Test command-line arguments
- Confirm logging works as expected
- Ensure proper error handling on startup failures

## Step 7: Implement Server Auto-Launch

**Branch name:** `feature/server-ui-integration`

### Implementation:
1. Modify `memory_server.py` to add UI launch options
2. Implement subprocess management for UI
3. Create connection info mechanism for UI-server communication
4. Add process lifecycle management

### Testing:
- Test server starts UI automatically
- Verify UI connects to server properly
- Test with various server modes (full, prompts-only, tools-only)
- Ensure clean shutdown of both server and UI

## Step 8: Add Configuration and Persistence

**Branch name:** `feature/ui-configuration`

### Implementation:
1. Add UI configuration options
2. Implement settings persistence
3. Create preferences dialog
4. Add window state persistence

### Testing:
- Verify settings are saved correctly
- Test that UI state persists between sessions
- Confirm configuration changes take effect

## Step 9: Enhance UI with Export/Import Features

**Branch name:** `feature/ui-export-import`

### Implementation:
1. Add functionality to export search results
2. Implement document import features
3. Create export/import dialogs
4. Add progress indicators

### Testing:
- Test export of search results to various formats
- Verify document import works correctly
- Confirm progress indicators show properly
- Test error handling during import/export

## Step 10: Complete Generic MCP Tools Integration

**Branch name:** `feature/generic-mcp-tools`

### Implementation:
1. Add new MCP tools that expose full generic collection capabilities:
   - `create_collection` - Create new custom collections
   - `list_collections` - List all available collections
   - `add_to_collection` - Add content to any collection
   - `query_collection` - Search within specific collections
   - `delete_collection` - Remove collections
   - `get_collection_stats` - Get collection statistics
2. Update `mcp_server.py` to include new tool definitions
3. Add corresponding handlers in `tool_handlers.py`

   - Migrate `global_memory` collection to `shared-knowledge`
   - Migrate `learned_memory` collection to `learned-patterns`
   - Migrate `agent_specific_memory` collections to `agent-context`
   - Preserve all metadata and maintain data integrity
2. Implement automatic migration on server startup
3. Add manual migration tools for advanced users
4. Create backup and rollback capabilities

- Perform final user experience testing

## Development Workflow Details

### Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b feature/branch-name
```

### Testing
1. Implement automated tests where possible
2. Perform manual testing of UI functionality
3. Check for visual issues and usability problems
4. Verify server functionality is not impacted

### Code Review and Merge
```bash
# After confirmation of successful testing
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature X"
git push origin feature/branch-name

# After review approval
git checkout master
git merge feature/branch-name
git push origin master

# Clean up
git branch -d feature/branch-name
```

## Contingency Planning

- If a step is too complex, consider breaking it into smaller sub-steps
- If integration issues arise, isolate the problematic component for focused debugging
- Keep feature branches short-lived to avoid merge conflicts
- Document any workarounds or known issues for future resolution

## Timeline Estimate

- Steps 1-3: 1-2 days
- Steps 4-6: 2-3 days
- Steps 7-8: 1-2 days
- Steps 9-10: 1-2 days (Generic MCP Tools)
- Step 11: 1-2 days (Legacy Data Migration)
- Step 12: 1-2 days (UI Polish)

Total estimated time: 7-13 days depending on complexity encountered during implementation.

**Note**: This plan assumes direct integration without a REST API layer. If requirements change to include a REST API, the plan would need to be revised to include API endpoint development and HTTP communication.
