# Global Development Standards

## Code Quality Standards

### General Principles
- Write code that is readable, maintainable, and testable
- Follow SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns
- Use consistent naming conventions across all projects
- Document complex business logic and architectural decisions

### Version Control
- Use conventional commits for clear change history
- Feature branches with descriptive names
- Pull request reviews required for all changes
- Keep commits small and focused on single changes

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic (minimum 80% coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for high-traffic components

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Self-documenting code with clear variable/function names
- Comments for complex algorithms and business rules
- API documentation with examples and use cases
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes

### Project Documentation
- README with setup instructions and development guide
- Contributing guidelines for new team members
- Deployment procedures and environment configuration
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication for production access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Regular access reviews and privilege cleanup
- Session management and timeout policies

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- PII data handling and anonymization procedures
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning
- Incident response procedures for security breaches

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Requirements
- API endpoints: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Page load times: < 2 seconds for initial load
- Database queries: < 100ms for simple operations
- Background jobs: Complete within allocated time windows

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling capability for all services
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Load testing for expected traffic patterns
