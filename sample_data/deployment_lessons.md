# Deployment Lessons Learned

## Friday Deployment Incident

**Date**: 2024-09-13  
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: 2 hour downtime

### What Happened
Deployed a "simple" configuration change at 4:30 PM on Friday. The change broke the authentication service, causing complete site outage.

### Root Cause
- Configuration change wasn't tested in staging environment
- Deployment happened during peak traffic hours
- Insufficient monitoring alerts for auth service
- No immediate rollback plan

### Lessons Learned
1. **Never deploy on Friday afternoons** - if something breaks, team isn't available for weekend fix
2. **Always test in staging first** - even "simple" changes can have unexpected interactions  
3. **Deploy during low-traffic hours** - minimize impact if issues occur
4. **Have rollback plan ready** - should be one-click operation
5. **Monitor critical services** - auth service downtime should trigger immediate alerts

### Prevention Measures
- Block Friday afternoon deployments in CI/CD pipeline
- Mandatory staging deployment with 24h soak time
- Enhanced monitoring for authentication services
- Automated rollback triggers for service health failures

## Database Migration Gone Wrong

**Date**: 2024-08-20  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: Data corruption in user profiles

### What Happened
Large database migration ran longer than expected, causing timeout and partial rollback that corrupted user profile data.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Test migrations on production-size dataset** - staging data was too small
2. **Break large migrations into smaller chunks** - avoid long-running transactions
3. **Always backup before migrations** - corruption recovery took 6 hours
4. **Monitor migration progress** - no visibility into completion status
5. **Have data validation scripts** - corruption wasn't detected immediately

### Prevention Measures
- Mandatory production-scale testing environment
- Migration chunking requirements for operations >5 minutes
- Automated pre-migration backups
- Post-migration data integrity validation scripts
