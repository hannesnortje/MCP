## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### **STEP 1: Markdown Processing Foundation** 
**Branch:** `feature/markdown-processing-foundation`
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Core missing functionality)

#### AI-Driven Content Processing Philosophy:
The markdown processor serves as a **Cursor-AI-friendly foundation** that leverages Cursor's built-in AI capabilities for intelligent content analysis and optimization. Rather than using external AI APIs, the system is structured to enable Cursor's AI to:

- **Analyze Content Semantics:** Understand meaning and context beyond keyword matching
- **Optimize for Database Storage:** Enhance content structure for better similarity search
- **Intelligent Categorization:** Use semantic understanding for memory type suggestions
- **Content Enhancement:** Improve clarity and searchability while preserving meaning
- **Context-Aware Processing:** Adapt analysis based on document type and content structure

This approach ensures the system benefits from AI intelligence while remaining independent of external API dependencies and leveraging the AI tool users already have available in their development environment.

#### What to Implement:

     - Leverage Cursor's AI to intelligently analyze markdown structure and meaning
     - Use Cursor AI to optimize content for semantic search and memory retrieval
     - AI-enhanced categorization with context-aware memory type suggestions
     - Intelligent content cleaning and formatting optimization
     - AI-driven summarization and key insight extraction
   - Header-aware chunking (900 tokens, 200 overlap) with AI-optimized boundaries
   - **AI-Enhanced Memory Type Suggestion System:**
     - Uses Cursor AI to analyze content semantics, not just keywords
     - AI suggests `global` for documentation, standards, reference materials
     - AI suggests `learned` for insights, patterns, best practices, lessons learned
     - AI suggests `agent` for task-specific, personal, contextual information

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Governance & Compliance)

#### Policy-as-Memory Philosophy:
The policy system transforms governance documents into enforceable, semantically searchable memory that agents must comply with. Unlike traditional rule engines, this system leverages the same vector search and AI capabilities used for general memory, making policies both discoverable and contextually relevant.

#### What to Implement:
1. **Create `policy_memory` Qdrant Collection:**
   - Schema: `rule_id`, `policy_version`, `policy_hash`, `title`, `section`, `source_path`, `chunk_index`, `text`, `severity`, `active`
   - Embedding configuration: Same as other collections (768d, cosine)
   - Indexing for fast rule lookup and semantic search

2. **Add Policy Tools to `src/tool_handlers.py`:**
   - `build_policy_from_markdown(directory="./policy", policy_version, activate=true)`
   - `get_policy_rulebook(version="latest")` â€” Return canonical JSON policy
   - `validate_json_against_schema(schema_name, candidate_json)` â€” Enforce required sections
   - `log_policy_violation(agent_id, rule_id, context)` â€” Track compliance issues
   - Update tool schemas in `src/mcp_server.py`

3. **Create Policy Processing Pipeline:**
   - **Policy File Discovery:** Scan `./policy/` directory for `.md` files
   - **Rule Extraction:** Parse `[RULE-ID]` format from list items
   - **Section Organization:** Group by headers (Principles, Forbidden Actions, Required Sections)
   - **Validation Engine:** Check rule ID uniqueness, format compliance
   - **Canonicalization:** Create deterministic JSON with SHA-256 hash
   - **Version Management:** Handle policy updates with hash verification

4. **Add Policy Resources:**
   - Enhanced `policy_rulebook` resource with full canonical JSON
   - `policy_violations_log` resource for compliance tracking
   - Integration with existing resource handler

5. **Agent Policy Binding:**
   - Modify agent startup to require policy version/hash
   - Policy compliance validation in all agent operations  
   - Automatic policy rule retrieval for context

#### Policy File Structure Requirements:
```
/policy/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-principles.md          # Core principles [P-001], [P-002]...

#### Testing Requirements:
- **Policy Parsing Tests:**
  - Valid policy files with proper `[RULE-ID]` format
  - Invalid files (duplicate IDs, missing IDs, malformed)
  - Policy directory scanning and file discovery
- **Policy Validation Tests:**  
  - Rule ID uniqueness enforcement
  - Policy versioning and hash consistency
  - Schema validation against required sections
- **Agent Compliance Tests:**
  - Agent startup with policy binding
  - Policy rule retrieval during operations
  - Violation logging and recovery
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Policy updates with hash verification
  - Multi-agent policy compliance
  - Performance with large policy sets

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Policy markdown files parsed correctly with rule ID extraction
- [ ] Policy versioning system with SHA-256 hash validation
- [ ] `policy_memory` collection stores searchable policy rules
- [ ] Canonical JSON policy resource with version/hash tracking
- [ ] Agent startup requires and validates policy binding
- [ ] Schema validation enforces required sections per policy
- [ ] Policy violations logged with context and rule references
- [ ] Policy updates trigger hash changes and require agent rebinding
- [ ] Semantic policy search works alongside rule lookup
- [ ] All policy integration tests pass
- [ ] No performance degradation with policy enforcement

#### Branch Commands:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/policy-memory-system
# Implement policy collection and tools
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add policy memory collection and basic tools"
# Implement policy processing pipeline
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add policy markdown processing and validation"
# Implement agent policy binding
git add .
git commit -m "feat: integrate policy compliance into agent operations"
git push origin feature/policy-memory-system
```

## Branch Management Workflow

### For Each Step:
1. **Start:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b [branch-name]
   ```

2. **During Development:**
   ```bash
   # Regular commits as you work
   git add .
   git commit -m "progress: [description]"
   ```

3. **Testing Phase:**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest tests/
   # Run specific tests for the feature
   pytest tests/test_[feature].py -v
   ```

4. **Ready for Review:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[type]: [final commit message]"
   git push origin [branch-name]
   ```

5. **After Review/Approval:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge [branch-name]
   git push origin main
   git branch -d [branch-name]
   ```

## Success Metrics

### After Each Step:
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Code coverage maintained/improved
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Final Success Criteria:
- [ ] Full IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md feature parity
- [ ] Complete MCP protocol compliance (Tools, Resources, Prompts)
- [ ] Robust markdown ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Multi-agent memory management
- [ ] **Policy memory system with governance and compliance**
- [ ] Production-ready error handling
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Risks:
- **Breaking existing functionality** â†’ Comprehensive test suite before each step
- **Integration issues** â†’ Test integration points early and often  
- **Performance degradation** â†’ Monitor performance during development
- **Configuration complexity** â†’ Maintain backwards compatibility
- **Data loss** â†’ Test with backup/restore procedures

### Recovery Plan:
If any step causes issues:
1. Rollback to previous stable state
2. Analyze and fix issues on feature branch
3. Re-test thoroughly before merging
4. Document lessons learned
