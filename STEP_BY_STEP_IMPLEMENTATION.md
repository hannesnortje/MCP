## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### **STEP 1: Markdown Processing Foundation** 
**Branch:** `feature/markdown-processing-foundation`
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Core missing functionality)

#### AI-Driven Content Processing Philosophy:
The markdown processor serves as a **Cursor-AI-friendly foundation** that leverages Cursor's built-in AI capabilities for intelligent content analysis and optimization. Rather than using external AI APIs, the system is structured to enable Cursor's AI to:

- **Analyze Content Semantics:** Understand meaning and context beyond keyword matching
- **Optimize for Database Storage:** Enhance content structure for better similarity search
- **Intelligent Categorization:** Use semantic understanding for memory type suggestions
- **Content Enhancement:** Improve clarity and searchability while preserving meaning
- **Context-Aware Processing:** Adapt analysis based on document type and content structure

This approach ensures the system benefits from AI intelligence while remaining independent of external API dependencies and leveraging the AI tool users already have available in their development environment.

#### What to Implement:
1. **Enhance `src/markdown_processor.py`**
   - Markdown file discovery and scanning with configurable directory paths
   - **Cursor-AI-Driven Content Analysis and Optimization:**

     - Use Cursor AI to optimize content for semantic search and memory retrieval
     - AI-enhanced categorization with context-aware memory type suggestions
     - Intelligent content cleaning and formatting optimization
     - AI-driven summarization and key insight extraction
   - Header-aware chunking (900 tokens, 200 overlap) with AI-optimized boundaries
   - **AI-Enhanced Memory Type Suggestion System:**
     - Uses Cursor AI to analyze content semantics, not just keywords
     - AI suggests `global` for documentation, standards, reference materials
     - AI suggests `learned` for insights, patterns, best practices, lessons learned
     - AI suggests `agent` for task-specific, personal, contextual information
     - AI provides intelligent reasoning for memory type recommendations
     - Cursor AI can enhance and refine suggestions based on content context
     - Always allows user override with AI-generated explanations
   - **Policy Markdown Processing (NEW):**
     - Policy directory scanning (`./policy/` by default)
     - Rule ID extraction from list items (`[RULE-ID]` format)

     - `extract_policy_rules(content)` â€” Parse rule IDs and sections from policy markdown
     - `validate_policy_rules(rules, policy_version)` â€” Check uniqueness and format compliance
   - **AI Integration Points:**
     - Each tool leverages Cursor AI for intelligent content processing
     - AI-driven content optimization before database storage
     - Semantic analysis for better memory type classification
     - Context-aware content enhancement and summarization
   - Update tool schemas in `src/mcp_server.py`

3. **Configuration Updates:**

### **STEP 9: Policy Memory System**
**Branch:** `feature/policy-memory-system`
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Governance & Compliance)

#### Policy-as-Memory Philosophy:
The policy system transforms governance documents into enforceable, semantically searchable memory that agents must comply with. Unlike traditional rule engines, this system leverages the same vector search and AI capabilities used for general memory, making policies both discoverable and contextually relevant.

#### What to Implement:
1. **Create `policy_memory` Qdrant Collection:**
   - Schema: `rule_id`, `policy_version`, `policy_hash`, `title`, `section`, `source_path`, `chunk_index`, `text`, `severity`, `active`
   - Embedding configuration: Same as other collections (768d, cosine)
   - Indexing for fast rule lookup and semantic search

2. **Add Policy Tools to `src/tool_handlers.py`:**
   - `build_policy_from_markdown(directory="./policy", policy_version, activate=true)`
   - `get_policy_rulebook(version="latest")` â€” Return canonical JSON policy
   - `validate_json_against_schema(schema_name, candidate_json)` â€” Enforce required sections
   - `log_policy_violation(agent_id, rule_id, context)` â€” Track compliance issues
   - Update tool schemas in `src/mcp_server.py`

3. **Create Policy Processing Pipeline:**
   - **Policy File Discovery:** Scan `./policy/` directory for `.md` files
   - **Rule Extraction:** Parse `[RULE-ID]` format from list items
   - **Section Organization:** Group by headers (Principles, Forbidden Actions, Required Sections)
   - **Validation Engine:** Check rule ID uniqueness, format compliance
   - **Canonicalization:** Create deterministic JSON with SHA-256 hash
   - **Version Management:** Handle policy updates with hash verification

4. **Add Policy Resources:**
   - Enhanced `policy_rulebook` resource with full canonical JSON
   - `policy_violations_log` resource for compliance tracking
   - Integration with existing resource handler

5. **Agent Policy Binding:**
   - Modify agent startup to require policy version/hash
   - Policy compliance validation in all agent operations  
   - Automatic policy rule retrieval for context

#### Policy File Structure Requirements:
```
/policy/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-principles.md          # Core principles [P-001], [P-002]...
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-forbidden-actions.md   # Prohibited actions [F-101], [F-102]...  
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-required-sections.md   # Schema requirements [R-201], [R-202]...
â””â”€â”€ 04-style-guide.md        # Output formatting [S-301], [S-302]...
```

#### Testing Requirements:
- **Policy Parsing Tests:**

- [ ] Policy versioning system with SHA-256 hash validation
- [ ] `policy_memory` collection stores searchable policy rules
- [ ] Canonical JSON policy resource with version/hash tracking
- [ ] Agent startup requires and validates policy binding
- [ ] Schema validation enforces required sections per policy
- [ ] Policy violations logged with context and rule references
- [ ] Policy updates trigger hash changes and require agent rebinding
- [ ] Semantic policy search works alongside rule lookup
- [ ] All policy integration tests pass
- [ ] No performance degradation with policy enforcement
