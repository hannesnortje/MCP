## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### **STEP 1: Markdown Processing Foundation** 
**Branch:** `feature/markdown-processing-foundation`
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Core missing functionality)

#### AI-Driven Content Processing Philosophy:
The markdown processor serves as a **Cursor-AI-friendly foundation** that leverages Cursor's built-in AI capabilities for intelligent content analysis and optimization. Rather than using external AI APIs, the system is structured to enable Cursor's AI to:

- **Analyze Content Semantics:** Understand meaning and context beyond keyword matching
- **Optimize for Database Storage:** Enhance content structure for better similarity search
- **Intelligent Categorization:** Use semantic understanding for memory type suggestions
- **Content Enhancement:** Improve clarity and searchability while preserving meaning
- **Context-Aware Processing:** Adapt analysis based on document type and content structure

This approach ensures the system benefits from AI intelligence while remaining independent of external API dependencies and leveraging the AI tool users already have available in their development environment.

     - Intelligent content cleaning and formatting optimization
     - AI-driven summarization and key insight extraction
   - Header-aware chunking (900 tokens, 200 overlap) with AI-optimized boundaries
   - **AI-Enhanced Memory Type Suggestion System:**
     - Uses Cursor AI to analyze content semantics, not just keywords
     - AI suggests `global` for documentation, standards, reference materials

#### Policy-as-Memory Philosophy:
The policy system transforms governance documents into enforceable, semantically searchable memory that agents must comply with. Unlike traditional rule engines, this system leverages the same vector search and AI capabilities used for general memory, making policies both discoverable and contextually relevant.

#### What to Implement:
1. **Create `policy_memory` Qdrant Collection:**
   - Schema: `rule_id`, `policy_version`, `policy_hash`, `title`, `section`, `source_path`, `chunk_index`, `text`, `severity`, `active`

   - **Rule Extraction:** Parse `[RULE-ID]` format from list items
   - **Section Organization:** Group by headers (Principles, Forbidden Actions, Required Sections)
   - **Validation Engine:** Check rule ID uniqueness, format compliance
   - **Canonicalization:** Create deterministic JSON with SHA-256 hash
   - **Version Management:** Handle policy updates with hash verification

4. **Add Policy Resources:**
   - Enhanced `policy_rulebook` resource with full canonical JSON
   - `policy_violations_log` resource for compliance tracking
   - Integration with existing resource handler

5. **Agent Policy Binding:**

   - Policy compliance validation in all agent operations  
   - Automatic policy rule retrieval for context

#### Policy File Structure Requirements:
```
/policy/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-principles.md          # Core principles [P-001], [P-002]...
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-forbidden-actions.md   # Prohibited actions [F-101], [F-102]...  
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-required-sections.md   # Schema requirements [R-201], [R-202]...
â””â”€â”€ 04-style-guide.md        # Output formatting [S-301], [S-302]...

- [ ] Complete MCP protocol compliance (Tools, Resources, Prompts)
- [ ] Robust markdown ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Multi-agent memory management
- [ ] **Policy memory system with governance and compliance**
- [ ] Production-ready error handling
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Risks:
- **Breaking existing functionality** â†’ Comprehensive test suite before each step
- **Integration issues** â†’ Test integration points early and often  
- **Performance degradation** â†’ Monitor performance during development
- **Configuration complexity** â†’ Maintain backwards compatibility
- **Data loss** â†’ Test with backup/restore procedures

### Recovery Plan:
If any step causes issues:
1. Rollback to previous stable state
2. Analyze and fix issues on feature branch
3. Re-test thoroughly before merging
4. Document lessons learned
