## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### **STEP 1: Markdown Processing Foundation** 
**Branch:** `feature/markdown-processing-foundation`
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Core missing functionality)

#### AI-Driven Content Processing Philosophy:
The markdown processor serves as a **Cursor-AI-friendly foundation** that leverages Cursor's built-in AI capabilities for intelligent content analysis and optimization. Rather than using external AI APIs, the system is structured to enable Cursor's AI to:

- **Analyze Content Semantics:** Understand meaning and context beyond keyword matching
- **Optimize for Database Storage:** Enhance content structure for better similarity search
- **Intelligent Categorization:** Use semantic understanding for memory type suggestions
- **Content Enhancement:** Improve clarity and searchability while preserving meaning
- **Context-Aware Processing:** Adapt analysis based on document type and content structure

This approach ensures the system benefits from AI intelligence while remaining independent of external API dependencies and leveraging the AI tool users already have available in their development environment.

#### What to Implement:
1. **Create `src/markdown_processor.py`**
   - Markdown file discovery and scanning with configurable directory paths
   - **Cursor-AI-Driven Content Analysis and Optimization:**
     - Leverage Cursor's AI to intelligently analyze markdown structure and meaning
     - Use Cursor AI to optimize content for semantic search and memory retrieval
     - AI-enhanced categorization with context-aware memory type suggestions
     - Intelligent content cleaning and formatting optimization
     - AI-driven summarization and key insight extraction
   - Header-aware chunking (900 tokens, 200 overlap) with AI-optimized boundaries
   - **AI-Enhanced Memory Type Suggestion System:**
     - Uses Cursor AI to analyze content semantics, not just keywords
     - AI suggests `global` for documentation, standards, reference materials
     - AI suggests `learned` for insights, patterns, best practices, lessons learned
     - AI suggests `agent` for task-specific, personal, contextual information
     - AI provides intelligent reasoning for memory type recommendations
     - Cursor AI can enhance and refine suggestions based on content context
     - Always allows user override with AI-generated explanations

2. **Add Tools to `src/tool_handlers.py`:**
   - `scan_workspace_markdown(directory="./", recursive=true)` 
   - `analyze_markdown_content(content, suggest_memory_type=true, ai_enhance=true)`
   - `optimize_content_for_storage(content, memory_type, ai_optimization=true, suggested_type=null)`
   - `process_markdown_directory(directory, memory_type=null, auto_suggest=true, ai_enhance=true)`
   - **AI Integration Points:**
     - Each tool leverages Cursor AI for intelligent content processing
     - AI-driven content optimization before database storage
     - Semantic analysis for better memory type classification
     - Context-aware content enhancement and summarization
   - Update tool schemas in `src/mcp_server.py`

3. **Configuration Updates:**
   - Add chunking configuration to `src/server_config.py`
   - Add markdown processing settings and constants
