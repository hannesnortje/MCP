## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### **STEP 1: Markdown Processing Foundation** 
**Branch:** `feature/markdown-processing-foundation`
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Core missing functionality)

#### AI-Driven Content Processing Philosophy:
The markdown processor serves as a **Cursor-AI-friendly foundation** that leverages Cursor's built-in AI capabilities for intelligent content analysis and optimization. Rather than using external AI APIs, the system is structured to enable Cursor's AI to:

- **Analyze Content Semantics:** Understand meaning and context beyond keyword matching
- **Optimize for Database Storage:** Enhance content structure for better similarity search
- **Intelligent Categorization:** Use semantic understanding for memory type suggestions
- **Content Enhancement:** Improve clarity and searchability while preserving meaning
- **Context-Aware Processing:** Adapt analysis based on document type and content structure

This approach ensures the system benefits from AI intelligence while remaining independent of external API dependencies and leveraging the AI tool users already have available in their development environment.

     - AI-enhanced categorization with context-aware memory type suggestions
     - Intelligent content cleaning and formatting optimization
     - AI-driven summarization and key insight extraction
   - Header-aware chunking (900 tokens, 200 overlap) with AI-optimized boundaries
   - **AI-Enhanced Memory Type Suggestion System:**
     - Uses Cursor AI to analyze content semantics, not just keywords
     - AI suggests `global` for documentation, standards, reference materials

   - Update tool schemas in `src/mcp_server.py`

3. **Create Policy Processing Pipeline:**
   - **Policy File Discovery:** Scan `./policy/` directory for `.md` files
   - **Rule Extraction:** Parse `[RULE-ID]` format from list items
   - **Section Organization:** Group by headers (Principles, Forbidden Actions, Required Sections)
   - **Validation Engine:** Check rule ID uniqueness, format compliance
   - **Canonicalization:** Create deterministic JSON with SHA-256 hash
   - **Version Management:** Handle policy updates with hash verification

4. **Add Policy Resources:**
   - Enhanced `policy_rulebook` resource with full canonical JSON
   - `policy_violations_log` resource for compliance tracking
   - Integration with existing resource handler

   - Policy compliance validation in all agent operations  
   - Automatic policy rule retrieval for context

#### Policy File Structure Requirements:
```
/policy/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-principles.md          # Core principles [P-001], [P-002]...
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-forbidden-actions.md   # Prohibited actions [F-101], [F-102]...  
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-required-sections.md   # Schema requirements [R-201], [R-202]...
â””â”€â”€ 04-style-guide.md        # Output formatting [S-301], [S-302]...
```

- [ ] Agent startup requires and validates policy binding
- [ ] Schema validation enforces required sections per policy
- [ ] Policy violations logged with context and rule references
- [ ] Policy updates trigger hash changes and require agent rebinding
- [ ] Semantic policy search works alongside rule lookup
